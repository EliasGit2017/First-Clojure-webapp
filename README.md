# basic-webapp

This repo is dedicated to my main clojure web app learning.  
I am currently starting with simple HTML5 and CSS formating and will shift to ReactJS when I feel more confident.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.  
You can take a look at it [here].

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein uberjar
    java -jar target/clojure-basic-webapp-standalone.jar 2365
    ln -s ~/Documents/TMP/Clojure-Material/markdown-clj/ ./checkouts/
    

## To Do

Will change this code to build a better personal version of it. Might host some static page in a very simple and  spartan style. Will try to put some reactJS in this.
